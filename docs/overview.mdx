# IPS Tech Club Website

Official platform for the IPS Tech Club community.

## Project Overview

The Tech Club Website is a modern web platform developed to represent the technical club online. The website is designed to provide information about the club, its activities, events, team members, and technical initiatives.

It also serves as a **centralized platform** where students and contributors can interact with club updates and resources.

> The project is built using a modern full-stack web development approach using Next.js, React, and TypeScript to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability.

The goal is to create a production-ready, contributor-friendly codebase that can grow as the club expands its digital presence.
